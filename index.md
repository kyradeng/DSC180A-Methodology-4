What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?\
The most interesting topic I have covered in my domain this quarter is using real mice data and learning about how we can use DTW to determine their circadian rythyms. It was interesting to see how by going back between the temperature data and activity data, we would still see the same circadian rythym patters being reflected. 

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.\
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be to take the real mice data and exploring whether or not estrous cycles actually affects the activity and temperature regulations within female mice, and if it changes the effectiveness of testing on female mice, male mice, or both equally.

What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?\
I think a potential change would be to make a more clear goal for the project, as opposed to spliting up tasks each week and coming back to debrief our findings. It would have been nicer to work on the same tasks, so it felt like a more cohesive project where everyone was working towards one very specific goal.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?\
I think some other techniques I would be interested in using for the project would be other dictionaries used to display visualizations. Although I am unsure of what those dictionaries might be, I know there are more out there, like ruptures.
